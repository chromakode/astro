## Why Markdoc?

Markdoc allows you to enhance your Markdown with [UI components][astro-ui-frameworks]. If you have existing content authored in Markdoc, this integration allows you to bring those files to your Astro project.

## Installation

### Quick Install

The `astro add` command-line tool automates the installation for you. Run one of the following commands in a new terminal window. (If you aren't sure which package manager you're using, run the first command.) Then, follow the prompts, and type "y" in the terminal (meaning "yes") for each one.

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add markdoc
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add markdoc
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add markdoc
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Manual Install

First, install the `@astrojs/markdoc` package using your package manager. If you're using npm or aren't sure, run this in the terminal:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/markdoc
```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

__`astro.config.mjs`__

```js ins={2} "markdoc()"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import markdoc from '@astrojs/markdoc';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [markdoc()],
});
```
